        In your main class, deal the user a hand of two cards
        Display the total of the two card values to the user
        If the cards equal 21, declare Black Jack and congratulate the user.
        If the cards are not equal to 21, ask the user to hit (get another card) or stay (take the current score and end the â€œhand)
        Allow the user to keep getting cards until their value exceeds 21 or they choose to stay
        Bonus: Can you figure out a way to handle Aces being worth 1 or 11?
        Super Bonus: Can you handle the dealer also playing a hand to see who wins with the closest score to 21?
